Hi Zubin,

Thank you for your questions. Here’s how I see my idea fitting into EXL’s context:

Sales Context for EXL:
I propose creating a “Client Operations Health Dashboard” – an automated analytics solution that integrates client operational data (claims, transactions, service requests, etc.) and highlights inefficiencies, cost leakages, and improvement opportunities in near real-time.
This can be positioned as a value-add service in sales conversations, helping EXL demonstrate proactive problem-solving and operational excellence.

Potential Industry Use Case:
Most relevant for Property & Casualty Insurance (where EXL already has a strong presence) and Healthcare clients. For example, in insurance, it could automatically detect claim anomalies, spot high-risk claim clusters, and recommend process optimizations — improving loss ratios and reducing fraud exposure.

Leverage for Sales/Growth Teams:
Sales teams can present this as a proof-of-concept accelerator during client pitches, showing that EXL not only runs operations but also continuously finds ways to save costs and improve KPIs. Growth teams can use dashboard insights to engage clients with data-backed opportunities for additional transformation projects, driving account expansion.



Nice — I’ll give you a concrete, hands-on step-by-step plan so you can build the Client Operations Health Dashboard from scratch using Python, SQL, SAS, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau. I’ll include code snippets, schema suggestions, KPIs, and exactly what to present to sales. Hard truth up front: don’t try to use every tool at once — pick Power BI for the final demo and use Python + SQL for ETL and modeling; use SAS for any statistical modelling if your interviewers expect it. Now let’s build.

Phase 0 — Define scope & KPIs (what you must deliver)

Executive KPI set (what sales cares about):

Total Claims, Total Payout

Avg Handling Time (days) = DateClosed − DateReported

SLA Compliance (%) = claims closed ≤ SLA / total claims

Cost Per Claim = Total Payout / Total Claims

Fraud Rate (%) = flagged fraud / total claims

Backlog (open claims older than X days)

Top 10 clients by cost

Monthly trend of claims and payouts

Anomaly / Fraud Score for each claim

Deliverables to prepare:

Synthetic or sample dataset (CSV)

ETL pipeline (Python) to load into SQL DW

Analytics scripts (Python and optional SAS)

Power BI prototype with 3–5 report pages

One-pager + demo script for sales

Phase 1 — Data model & sample schema

Create a small star schema centered on a Claims fact table and dimension tables.

Example Claims fields (CSV / table):

ClaimID, ClientID, ClientName, PolicyID, Product, ClaimType,
ReportedDate, ClosedDate, ClaimAmount, PayoutAmount,
AdjusterID, Region, Channel, ProcessingTimeDays, SLA_Days,
FraudLabel (0/1 optional), Notes


Dimension tables:

Clients(ClientID, Industry, Region, Tier)

Adjusters(AdjusterID, Name, Team)

Calendar(Date, Year, Month, Weekday)

Sample create (PostgreSQL style):

CREATE TABLE claims (
  claim_id varchar PRIMARY KEY,
  client_id varchar,
  reported_date date,
  closed_date date,
  claim_amount numeric,
  payout_amount numeric,
  adjuster_id varchar,
  claim_type varchar,
  region varchar,
  processing_time_days int,
  sla_days int
);

Phase 2 — ETL: extract, transform, load (use Python + SQL)

Use Python (pandas + SQLAlchemy) to:

Ingest CSVs / source files

Clean and standardize

Compute derived fields (processing_time, SLA_breach flag)

Load to a database (Postgres / SQL Server / Azure SQL)

Example Python ETL snippet:

import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# load
df = pd.read_csv('claims_sample.csv', parse_dates=['ReportedDate','ClosedDate'])

# clean
df = df.drop_duplicates(subset='ClaimID')
df['ProcessingTimeDays'] = (df['ClosedDate'] - df['ReportedDate']).dt.days
df['SLA_Breach'] = (df['ProcessingTimeDays'] > df['SLA_Days']).astype(int)

# connect and upsert to SQL
engine = create_engine('postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db')
df.to_sql('claims', engine, if_exists='replace', index=False)


Tips:

Log ETL steps and row counts (so sales hears “we validated X rows”).

Add small unit tests: row count > 0, no negative payouts, date ordering checks.

Phase 3 — Data quality & feature engineering

Do this before modeling or dashboarding.

Remove duplicates, fix invalid dates, standardize categorical values.

Feature engineering ideas:

ClaimLag = ReportedDate - PolicyIssueDate (if available)

HandlingTime = ClosedDate - ReportedDate

Rolling 7/30-day averages by client or adjuster

One-hot encode ClaimType or use categorical groupings

Rule-based fraud features: extremely high claim amounts vs client average, many claims from same policy, suspicious adjuster patterns.

Python example to create rolling averages by client:

df = df.sort_values(['ClientID','ReportedDate'])
df['monthly_claims'] = df.groupby('ClientID')['ClaimID'].transform(lambda x: x.rolling(window=30, min_periods=1).count())

Phase 4 — Analytics & models (Python & SAS)

Start with lightweight models that produce actionable results.

A) Anomaly detection (Python, unsupervised)

from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
features = df[['ClaimAmount','ProcessingTimeDays','monthly_claims']].fillna(0)
iso = IsolationForest(contamination=0.01, random_state=42).fit(features)
df['anomaly_score'] = iso.decision_function(features)
df['anomaly_flag'] = iso.predict(features) == -1


Save anomaly_score and anomaly_flag to the claims table — used in BI.

B) Fraud probability model (SAS example)
If your team expects SAS, show a simple logistic model:

proc logistic data=claims;
  class claim_type region / param=ref;
  model FraudLabel(event='1') = ClaimAmount ProcessingTimeDays claim_type region;
  output out=claims_scored p=fraud_prob;
run;


C) Severity model (predict payout) — use RandomForest in Python or PROC HPFOREST in SAS.

Phase 5 — Dashboard design (Power BI preferred for the demo)

Design 3–5 pages. Keep it simple and sales-friendly.

Pages & visuals:

Executive Summary (single-page snapshot)

KPIs (cards): Total Claims, Total Payout, Avg Handling Time, SLA Compliance, Fraud Rate

Trend lines: Claims by month, Payout by month

Top 5 clients by cost (bar)

Quick ROI callout: potential monthly savings (formula below)

Operational Efficiency (drillable)

Heatmap by region/adjuster of Avg Handling Time

Backlog gauge

Root-cause table (claim type vs handling time) with drill-through

Fraud & Anomalies

Scatter of ClaimAmount vs ProcessingTime with anomaly color

Table of top suspicious claims (detail that sales can present)

Confusion matrix / precision if using labeled data (optional)

Ad-hoc Drill / Client View

Slicer by Client, Product, Region

Table with claim details and model scores

Power BI DAX examples:

TotalClaims = COUNTROWS(Claims)

TotalPayout = SUM(Claims[PayoutAmount])

AvgHandlingDays = AVERAGEX(Claims, DATEDIFF(Claims[ReportedDate], Claims[ClosedDate], DAY))

SLA_Compliance = DIVIDE(
  CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Claims), FILTER(Claims, DATEDIFF(Claims[ReportedDate], Claims[ClosedDate], DAY) <= Claims[SLA_Days])),
  COUNTROWS(Claims)
)


Design principles:

Use KPI cards at top, clear call-to-action (e.g., “Contact client: client X — potential saving Y”).

Put actionable filters (Client, Region, Adjuster) on left.

For Tableau: same visuals; calculated fields instead of DAX.

Phase 6 — Synthetic data & prototype steps (if you don’t have live data)

Generate a realistic dataset to demo:

Python generator snippet:

import pandas as pd, numpy as np
N = 5000
df = pd.DataFrame({
  'ClaimID': [f'C{i}' for i in range(N)],
  'ClientID': np.random.choice([f'CL{i}' for i in range(50)], N),
  'ReportedDate': pd.to_datetime('2024-01-01') + pd.to_timedelta(np.random.randint(0,365,size=N), unit='d'),
  'ClaimAmount': np.round(np.random.exponential(2000, size=N),0)
})
df['ClosedDate'] = df['ReportedDate'] + pd.to_timedelta(np.random.poisson(7, size=N), unit='d')
df['PayoutAmount'] = df['ClaimAmount'] * np.random.uniform(0.5,1.0,size=N)
df.to_csv('claims_demo.csv', index=False)


Load that CSV into your SQL DB and Power BI. This is enough for a convincing demo.

Phase 7 — Testing, validation & QA

Validate metrics with SQL queries and Excel pivot tables (sanity checks).

Test model outputs: manually inspect top flagged claims.

Create a small test suite for ETL: row counts, null checks, date consistency.

Example SQL sanity checks:

-- no negative payouts
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM claims WHERE payout_amount < 0;

-- average processing time
SELECT AVG(closed_date - reported_date) FROM claims;

Phase 8 — Sales materials & demo script (what to say)

One-pager contents:

Problem: “Clients lose X% to processing inefficiency & fraud”

Solution: “Operations Health Dashboard — real-time visibility + anomaly detection”

Benefits: Faster decision-making, measurable cost reductions, upsell opportunities

Ask: “Request a 4-week POC” — (if they push for timeline, DON’T promise a timeframe here in the doc; say “POC proposed”)

Demo script (talking points):

Start with KPI snapshot (what’s the current health)

Show a recent anomaly and explain how we detected it and the potential savings

Drill into client-level view to show how sales can make an immediate ask to upsell optimization

Close with “We can run a POC with one client and demonstrate X% improvement or $Y savings”

ROI formula (show how sales will value it):

Estimated Annual Savings = (#DetectedAnomalies_per_month) * (AvgClaimPayout) * (DetectionAccuracy) * 12 * (RecoveryRate)

Phase 9 — Folder structure & version control
client-ops-dashboard/
  ├─ data/ (csv samples)
  ├─ etl/
     └─ etl_pipeline.py
  ├─ models/
     └─ anomaly_model.pkl
  ├─ sql/
     └─ create_tables.sql
     ├─ queries/
  ├─ powerbi/
     └─ pbix files
  ├─ docs/
     └─ onepager.md, demo_script.md


Check everything into Git; push to GitHub (or corporate Git) with README showing how to run.

Quick copy-paste elevator pitch (1–2 lines)

“Client Operations Health Dashboard: a near-real-time analytics + anomaly detection system for insurance operations that reduces payout leakage and SLA breaches — demoable as a POC with measurable cost savings.”

Brutal-but-useful advice

Don’t try to build everything at once. First deliver: a working ETL → SQL → Power BI sample with synthetic data + one anomaly story. Sales will buy a story, not a lab.

Measure everything you show (row counts, percent changes). If your dashboard shows numbers, you must be able to prove them with one SQL query on demand.

If using SAS, use it for the final statistical model only; do the rest in Python so you can iterate fast.
