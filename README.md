Problem Statement

Insurance and healthcare clients handle thousands of claims and service requests every month.
However, they face three major challenges:

Limited visibility – Operations leaders cannot easily see real-time claim volumes, payout trends, or SLA breaches across regions and clients.

Hidden inefficiencies – Delayed claims, excessive payouts, and bottlenecks often go unnoticed until they become costly problems.

Reactive fraud detection – Most fraud or anomaly detection happens after the payout is made, leading to preventable financial losses.

This results in higher costs, slower operations, and reduced client satisfaction, affecting EXL’s ability to upsell transformation projects and prove measurable value to clients.

Solution Statement

Develop a Client Operations Health Dashboard powered by data integration, advanced analytics, and machine learning to:

Consolidate data from multiple systems (claims, policies, clients) into a single, clean source of truth.

Provide real-time KPIs like total claims, payout amounts, average handling time, backlog, SLA compliance, and fraud rate.

Use ML-based anomaly detection (Isolation Forest) to flag suspicious or high-impact claims early.

Enable drill-downs by client, region, adjuster, or claim type for root-cause analysis.

Empower sales teams with data-driven insights to engage clients on cost savings, process improvements, and new project opportunities.

This solution will act as a health check tool for client operations, reduce payout leakage, improve SLA compliance, and strengthen EXL’s positioning as a transformation partner.

Problem Statement:

Traditional SOP creation is time-consuming, manual, and error-prone.

It takes 3 days (~24 hours) for a worker to create a single SOP.

Relies on memory recall and post-process documentation, leading to missed steps and inconsistencies.

Requires manual formatting, screenshots, and editing, making updates slow and costly.

Results in text-heavy, hard-to-follow SOPs that reduce training efficiency and process compliance.

Solution Statement:

We developed a Python-based automated SOP generation system that:

Captures screen/video in real time as the user performs tasks.

Takes snapshots on-demand and prompts for step descriptions instantly.

Automatically compiles all steps into a clean, visual SOP in PDF, Word, or HTML format.

Saves a full video archive for training, audit, or reference purposes.

Cuts SOP creation time from 24 hours to just 7 minutes, saving over 99% of time and cost.
